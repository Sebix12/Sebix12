# Hi, I'm Sebastian üëã

I'm a full-stack developer, electrotechnician student, and infrastructure enthusiast based in Hungary. I build automation tools, bots, monitoring systems, and self-hosted services running on Proxmox, Debian, nginx, and low-level Linux.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Do

- **GABS**: Creator of a real-time Discord moderation bot with an SQLite backend, live control panel, and modular plugin support.
- **Automation**: Develop advanced Windows batch scripts, perform penetration testing, and manage Minecraft servers, backups, and network infrastructure.
- **Homelab**: Operate a fully self-hosted infrastructure stack including servers, networking gear, and custom-built tools. It powers everything from game servers and Proxmox virtualization to audio routing and backups.

- Handles all incoming requests, backend/frontend, and Minecraft computation
- Dual gateway connections + tunnel to backup

### IBM Server (Storage Node)

- 8-core CPU, 48GB DDR3 ECC RAM
- 3√ó1.8TB HDDs for storage + 1TB cache HDD
- Dual 60GB SAS RAID 1 boot drives
- Runs TrueNAS CORE with IPMI
- Handles storage, compression, and file management (~3.5TB)

### Networking & Integration

## üîß Services & Automation

- Power Distribution Unit (custom-built)
- Backup portals with auto-generated index

Everything is scripted or automated where possible using Bash, Python, and systemd services. From nightly backups to dynamic DNS and Discord bot-based monitoring (like GABS), it's all designed to run hands-off.
